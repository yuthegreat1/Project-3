# Project-3 Proposal
We want to take a look at Passing, Rushing, and Receiving players in the NFL to determine the top players in each respective area. We will scrape the data provided by https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/receiving_advanced.htm# to look at the 2021 NFL season. This data will be formatted into multiple charts in order to determine the top player in each statistic or combonation of statistics. We will use the additional javascript library Recharts, and store the data in SQLite. This data will be accessed by published in a PythonFlask API and accessed through our created API. 
# rough outline of steps
Scrape --> store data in sqlite --> query that data with a flask API --> visualize it with the new js library and d3
10-3-9 is a good example of whats happening
